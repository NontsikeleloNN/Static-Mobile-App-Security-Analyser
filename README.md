# Static-Mobile-App-Security-Analyser
The objective of this project is to propose a mobile app security analyser capable
of conducting comprehensive assessments, including SQL injection analysis and
tainted data analysis. By performing SQL injection and tainted data analysis,
the tool aims to proactively identify vulnerabilities rooted in the source code,
arising from inadequate validation or sanitation of external inputs. This approach
significantly reduces user risk, as mobile applications are restricted to accessing
only essential data.
The proposed solution will deliver detailed and informative reports on the

analyzed mobile applicationâ€™s status, accompanied by actionable recommenda-
tions to enhance its security posture. This approach emphasizes a proactive

stance against cyber threats, focusing on preventing attacks rather than reac-
tive damage control measures.
