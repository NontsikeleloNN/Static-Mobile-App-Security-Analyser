if there is a connection (+ or = ) between 2 variables and one of them is tainted, then both will be tainted and then
form the connection between the 2 variables 

>> maybe I could find functions that sanitize input and see if the tainted variable is sent as input and do this for the sql inj too
>> it currently finds variables but only adds the first one [fixed]
>> it says that all variables are dirty/tainted even though not all of them are clean [fixed]
** to continue: add lines that do not end in a ;  // putting a pause on this

Need to do:
- test for sanitisation and validation
- eliminate analysing things in quotation marks (it finds var names)
